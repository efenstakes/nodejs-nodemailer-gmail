# NodeJS, Nodemailer + GMAIL
*This is a guide on how to use NodeJS, Nodemailer and Gmail.*

For Gmail to be used with nodemailer, we have to use `App Passwords` now because they changed the old style of using `email` and `password`.

In this repo, I create a simple nodejs function that can send emails.

To start using this repo, clone it from github:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/efenstakes/nodejs-nodemailer-gmail
```

## Get your App Password (Gmail)
1. Go to Google Account Manage accounts and enable `2 Factor Authentication` [https://myaccount.google.com/security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. Go to the Google Account you want to use for sending email through NodeMailer.
3. Visit [https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).
4. Give your app a name like "`NodeMailer`", then click `Create`.
6. Copy the App password generated by Google. 


## Setup .env file
In `.env`, add a `GOOGLE_MAIL_APP_PASSWORD` variable key and set the value as the `App Password` you copied from Gmail.

You're ready to rock. Just run:

```sh
npm run start
```
